# ML Models

This repository contains python versions of some Deep Neural Network Architectures used in projects and courses during my 2 years of master studies at Ecole Polytechnique (France) and the Imperial College (UK).

__Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) :__

* Residual Network (ResNet-18) _(With CIFAR-10 training example)_

__Generative Networks :__

* Variationnal Auto-Encoder _(With MNIST training example)_
* Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) _(With CIFAR-10 training example)_

__Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) :__

* Simple RNN model
* Long-Short Term Memory unit model (LSTM)
* Gated Recurrent Unit model (GRU)
